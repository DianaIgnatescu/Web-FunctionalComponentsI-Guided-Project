# Objectives
  * describe ReactJS and the problems that it tries to solve
  * use an html file set up a react environment and mount an application to a target DOM element using React and ReactDOM.render
  * use JSX to mount a DOM element and display that element in a web browser
  * explain how components work, and implement a functional component to render a piece of UI to the screen

# Final App
This app should render a few very simple components from app.js. Each component should only render one DOM element, like a header or button, or input, etc. They should each be in their own files, and be exported from that file and imported into app.js.

# Gotchas:
Importing is not an objective, but needs to be covered for the students to be able to do this module's project.

# Requirements
We need `node` & `npm`, as well as packages `live-server` and `eslint` installed _globally_. VSCode's `eslint` extension is recommended. Command line commands are run inside the project folder. This guide uses npm but should work the same using yarn.
